            Hello! I am Luis Manzanero - An Aspiring environmental scientist and
            experienced full stack web and mobile developer. I am from the world
            most beautiful country, Belize! Growing up in the jungles of Belize,
            it is no surprise that the environment plays a major role in my
            life. I am always trying to learn new things and apply what I learn
            with the things that make me happy and this world more sustainable.
            Recently, I have been involved in various <a href="/projects"
              >projects
            </a> related to blockchain, web and mobile development. My curiosty and
            drive to learn has brought many <a href="/resume">opportunities</a>,
            which has cultivated a hollistic approach to save the environment
            and improve our lives through innovations with technology. I also
            enjoy writing about various topics which you can read on my <a
              href="/blog">blog</a
            >
          </p>
          <br />
          <span>I'd love to explore ways we can collaborate on a project!</span>
